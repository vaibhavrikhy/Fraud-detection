**Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning**

Detecting suspicious financial transactions with data-driven intelligence


✨ Why This Project?

Financial fraud is rare, expensive, and extremely hard to catch.
This project tackles real-world fraud detection challenges such as:

⚖️ Severely imbalanced data

💸 High cost of missed fraud

📉 Noisy, high-dimensional features

🎯 Precision vs Recall trade-offs

Built fully in Google Colab, this project focuses on practical ML decision-making, not just accuracy scores.

🧠 What This Project Does

✔️ Explores transaction-level financial data
✔️ Handles class imbalance intelligently
✔️ Trains and evaluates multiple ML models
✔️ Compares performance using fraud-focused metrics

All logic, experimentation, and analysis live inside a single Colab notebook for easy reproducibility.

Evaluation & Comparison

📈 Model Evaluation

Instead of focusing only on accuracy, this project emphasizes:

Recall → Catching as much fraud as possible

Precision → Reducing false alarms

F1-Score → Balanced performance

Confusion Matrix → Clear error analysis

This mirrors how fraud detection is evaluated in industry.
